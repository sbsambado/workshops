## Dataframe manipulation with `plyr` - Software Carpentry Workshop


#### Agenda 

+ Big picture
+ Set up
+ Tools & Exercises 
+ Questions
+ Debrief  


>[link to R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis material](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/12-plyr/index.html)


*heads up*: I tend to use a certain type of language while live coding 

+ function(argument) 

+ HINT: DATASET, COLUMN, VARIABLE, OBSERVATION


**note: feel free to ask questions at any point during the lesson**





### Big Picture

+ sometimes you need a lot of information to address your question

+ most times, all the information you need won't be in 1 dataframe

+ if you are working with multiple dataframes, you need to record where and how you combined them to get reproducible results


### Set Up

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# necessary packages

# install.packages("plyr") for first timers!

library(plyr) # load package


# necessary dataframes

  # Dataframe 1 -- from Carpentry
gapminder <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE) 


# as always, look at your data before manipulating it

str(gapminder)


```


### Tools & Exercises

![plyr](./plyr_graphic.png)


**The plyr manta: split - apply - combine**

1. A *splitting* operation
2. *Apply* a function on each split in turn
3. *Recombine* output data as a single data object


But really, there are 9 core functions that follow XXply name structure

+ the functions are named based on data structure for input & output

+ *input* structure could be --> array, dataframe, list, n replicates, function arguments

+ *output* structure could be --> array, dataframe, list, nothing

![plyr functions](./plyr_functions.png)


#### quick rules

XXply(.data, .variables, .fun)

+ first X is input, second X is output
+ .data -- data object to be processed
+ .variables -- identify splitting variables
+ .fun -- function to be called on each piece 

```{r}
library(plyr)

# What is the mean GDP per continent?
ddply(
 .data = calcGDP(gapminder), # function we made from yesterday
 .variables = "continent",
 .fun = function(x) mean(x$gdp)
)
```

Challenge: What is the average life expectancy per continent?

```{r}
ddply(
  .data = gapminder,
  .variable = "continent",
  .fun = function(x) mean(x$lifeExp)
)


# what if I wanted to make into a list as an output

dlply(
  .data = gapminder, 
  .variable = "continent",
  .fun = function(x) mean(x$lifeExp)
)
```

what if you wanted to combine by multiple groups? (i.e. continent and year)
```{r}
ddply(
  .data = gapminder,
  .variable = c("continent", "year"),
  .fun = function(x) mean(x$lifeExp)
)

# what would that look like as an array?

daply(
  .data = gapminder,
  .variable = c("continent", "year"),
  .fun = function(x) mean(x$lifeExp)
)
```
Let's put some for loops in this

```{r}
# what is the mean gdpPercap for each continent and we want to print out these results in a reader friendly way 

d_ply(
  .data = gapminder,
  .variables = "continent",
  .fun = function(x) { 
    meanGDPperCap <- mean(x$gdpPercap) # calculate mean
    print(paste( # print out things of intererst
      "The mean gdp per capita for", unique(x$continent),
      "is", format(meanGDPperCap, big.mark = ",")
    ))
  }
)


?format()
```

Challenge 2: calculate the average life expectancy per continent and year. Which had the longest and shortest in 2007?

```{r}
solution <- ddply(
  .data = gapminder,
  .variables = c("continent", "year"),
  .fun = function(x) mean(x$lifeExp)
)

str(solution)

# longest life expect?

# HINT: DATAFRAM

solution[solution$year == 2007,]

XXplyr



```
