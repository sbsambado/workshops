## Dataframe manipulation with `dplyr` - Software Carpentry Workshop


#### Agenda 

+ Big picture
+ Set up
+ Tools & Exercises 
+ Questions
+ Debrief  


>[link to R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis material](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/13-dplyr/index.html)


*heads up*: I tend to use a certain type of language while live coding 

+ function(argument) 

+ HINT: DATASET, COLUMN, VARIABLE, OBSERVATION

**note: feel free to ask questions at any point during the lesson*




### Big Picture

+ minutia is fine, however, sometimes we just want summarized data

+ dplyr is a quick n dirty way to get the info you need


### Step Up

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# necessary packages

# install.packages("dplyr") for first timers!

library(dplyr) # load package


# necessary dataframes

  # Dataframe 1 -- from Carpentry
gapminder <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE) 


# as always, look at your data before manipulating it

str(gapminder)
```

### Tools and Exercises

#### The base way
```{r}
# syntax heavy
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Africa", "gdpPercap"])
```

#### The dplyr way 
```{r}

# what is the gdp per cap of africa?

# | is also a pipe
# %in% is also a pipe

# %>% og pipe for today's lesson

gapminder %>% #dataset
  filter(continent == "Africa") %>%
  summarize(mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap))

```

*Question: Which method, base or dplyr, makes most sense to you?*


**5 common functions of dplyr**

a) select() -- to choose variables from a dataframe

b) filter() -- to choose data based on values

c) group_by() -- when you have specific criteria

d) summarize() -- when you need info about variables

e) mutate() --  to create new variables


#### Other important tools to merge with dplr

a) pipes %>%

b) ifelse 
  + may not get to full explanation but can explore on your own time!


**a) select(): How to choose columns of interest** 
```{r}
# Exercise 1: let's choose the variables year, country, and gdpPercap
  # HINT: VECTORNAME_NEW <- select(DATAFRAME, COLUMN1, COLUMN2, COLUMN3)

info <- gapminder %>%
  select(year, country, gdpPercap)

dim(info)
# Exercise 2: select all columns but continent
  # HINT: VECTORNAME_NEW <- select(DATAFRAME, - COLUMN1)

info2 <- gapminder %>%
  select(-continent)
dim(info2)


# Exercise 3: let's do the same as exercise 1, but use a pipe

year_country_gdp <- gapminder %>%
  select(year, country, gdpPercap)


```

**b) filter(): How to eliminate groups & chose columns of interest**
```{r}
# Exercise 1: let's choose observations from European continent and select for year, country, gdpPercap
  # HINT: VECTORNAME_NEW <- DATAFRAME %>%
    # filter(FACTOR == "GROUP/LEVEL") %>%
    # select(COLUMN1, COLUMN2, COLUMN3)

unique(gapminder$continent)
info3 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
  select(year, country, gdpPercap)


# Exercise 2: let's choose observations from European continent and select for country, lifeExp AND specify year is 2007
  # HINT: VECTORNAME_NEW <- DATAFRAME %>%
    # filter(FACTOR1 == "GROUP/LEVEL", FACTOR2 == 2007) %>%
    # select(COLUMN1, COLUMN2, COLUMN3)

info4 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe", year == 2007) %>%
  select(country, lifeExp)


# Exercise 3: what happens if we used 'select()' first and then 'filter()'

europe_2007 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe", year == 2007) %>%
  select(country, lifeExp)



  # select first, you omit too much information to later identify your filter
europe_lifeExp_2007 <- gapminder %>%
  select(country, lifeExp) %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe", year == 2007) 
  
## so f before s like the alphabet when using dplyr

```


**c) group_by(): How to eliminate repeating steps and group by specific criteria**
```{r}



# Exercise 1: Group by continent
  # HINT: DATAFRAME %>%
    # group_by(VARIABLE)

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(life = mean(lifeExp))

# what is the difference between output of gapminder and our group_by command?

gapminder
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent)


# other groups

gapminder %>%
  group_by(year, country) %>%
  summarize(life = mean(lifeExp))



```

**d) summarize(): How to get the info you want**
```{r}
# building off of the group_by

# Exercise 1: What is the mean gdp for each continent?
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(money = mean(gdpPercap)) # can replace mean with any summary argument but keep variable/column of interest the same, # name your column

# what other summarize statistics can we do?

?summarize()

# Exercise 2: What is the median life expectancy in Europe in year 2002?

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent == "Europe") %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  summarize(median_life = median(lifeExp))


# Exercise 3: How to do all the summaries by year?

gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>% # new vector put in dataset gapminder
    group_by(year) %>% # and then group by year
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap), # i want summarize the mean gdp
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap), # i want to summarize sd of gdp
              mean_pop = mean(pop), # i want to know mean population
              sd_pop = sd(pop)) # i want to know the sd of population 

gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear


# Exercise 4: How to count total observations in your manipulation?

# Option 1: use count() to get raw total
info5 <- gapminder %>% # call in dataset
    filter(year == 2002) %>% # filter by year or criteria of interest
    count(continent) # count all the rows in your continent 


# look into how to reverse order of rows not columns


?sort()

# Option 2: use n() which is helpful when you want to count observations in group with a specific column

gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarize(se_le = sd(lifeExp)/sqrt(n())) 
```

**d) mutate(): How to create new variables based on data you already have**
```{r}

# let's bring in what we have used and comment this code together

gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>% # new vector, put old dataframe in
    mutate(gdp_billion = gdpPercap*pop/10^9) %>% # want to create column called gdp_billion, and within that column I want to take my original colum 'gdpPercap' x my other column 'pop' and divide by math
    group_by(continent,year) %>% # group by columns of interest
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap), # calculate summary statistics of interest
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop),
              mean_gdp_billion = mean(gdp_billion),
              sd_gdp_billion = sd(gdp_billion))
```

#### Optional: connect mutate() with logical filtering: ifelse()
```{r}
# let's bring in what we have used and comment this code together

## keeping all data but "filtering" after a certain condition
# calculate GDP only for people with a life expectation above 25
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear_above25 <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp_billion = ifelse(lifeExp > 25, gdpPercap * pop / 10^9, NA)) %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop = mean(pop),
              sd_pop = sd(pop),
              mean_gdp_billion = mean(gdp_billion),
              sd_gdp_billion = sd(gdp_billion))


```


### Debrief

+ use dplyr() to manipulate dataframes

+ use select() to choose variables from a dataframe

+ use filter() to choose data based on values

+ use group_by() and summarize() to work with subsets of data

+ use mutate() to create new variables
